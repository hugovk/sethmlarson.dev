# YouTube without YouTube Shorts

<p>Back in October 2023 I wrote about how <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/for-you-is-not-for-me">“For You” wasn't for me</a>,
and my dislike for infinitely-scrolling algorithmically-suggested content.
In that post I mentioned that I removed YouTube from my phone due to
the “YouTube Shorts” feature which functions similar to TikTok.</p>

<p>That didn't last long. I enjoy many creators on YouTube, so eventually
I ended up reinstalling the app. But my problem persisted: I would
find myself opening up YouTube and occasionally scrolling through Shorts for longer than I wanted to.</p>

<p>What I wanted was <strong>YouTube without Shorts</strong>, but there didn't seem to be any
way to disable them in the app. I was complaining about this to a friend, who out of nowhere mentioned that disabling
your “Watch History” will disable the YouTube Shorts infinite feed. <em>My mind was blown!</em> 🤯</p>

I disabled my Watch History and deleted my existing history and sure enough,
<strong>no Shorts!</strong> (also no home page, which I can also live without). Here's how to do it:

* Open YouTube app, select “You” (bottom-right on iOS)
* Settings cog in the top-right
* Manage all history, wait for the Google Account page to load
* Select “Turn Off” for YouTube History
* Select “Manage History” and delete all history
* Go back to the home page and see that Shorts no longer loads!
* Might have to restart the app, if I remember correctly I had to?

Lesson learned: complain about hyper-specific problems to your friends more often.
