# 2024 Minnesota State Fair foods

If you didn't know, I'm from Minnesota. Minnesotans love their State Fair,
and I'm not an exception! My wife and I were lucky enough to go to a State Fair
preview for LuLu's Public House for [fried ranch dressing](https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/deep-fried-ranch-dressing/) among a handful of new
drinks. I [shared my thoughts on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@sethmlarson/113000751781981825) and a few folks seemed interested in hearing more: so here's more!

## Cajun fried pickles from [The Perfect Pickle](https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/3089.1/)

These are hands-down the best food at the Minnesota State Fair. You eat an order,
ponder getting more (some years we do!) and then wonder to yourself why they put
the **best of the best** right next to the shuttle entrance. Don't go out looking for
answers lest they move these further away, sometimes it's best to
leave sleeping ‚Äú[pickle dogs](https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/3060.1/)‚Äù lie.

Seriously, if you like pickles even a little bit, get these pickles.
You can get them quick if you're lucky and other folks don't realize there are
supposed to be six lines of people taking orders.

They're ripping hot right when they hand them to you, so if you're like me
and enjoy food ‚Äúbiting back‚Äù then don't delay! üî• 

This year included a noticeable increase in the amount of Cajun seasoning,
or we got lucky and someone behind the scenes gave us an extra
coating (either way we're not complaining!)

## [Peanut Butter Bacon Cakes](https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/pb-bacon-cakes/) and from [The Blue Barn](https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/1968.1/)

Celebrating their 10th consecutive year at the Minnesota State Fair, The Blue Barn
is always a fan favorite. Seriously, run over there if you get to the fair early to
beat the massive lines for food and drinks.

We grabbed the new Peanut Butter Bacon Cakes along with the returning classic
Blue Cheese & Corn Fritz which I had never tried before.

The Peanut Butter Bacon Cakes were really great, there was thick-cut bacon
griddled inside of pancake batter strips along with jelly and a peanut butter
whipped cream. Perfect combo of savory and sweet, and you're in complete control of the ratios.
The bacon and pancake flavors reminded me of learning to make pancakes with my late grandfather.
Although *that* bacon was microwave-ready Hormel bacon... I promise this one's delish!

The Blue Cheese & Corn Fritz was really great, I missed out on this
one last year. Perfect amount of sweetness from the corn, really well-balanced cheesy little bite!
Wish I could have had more than one of these, we were sharing amongst a big group!

## [Wrangler Waffle Burger](https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/wrangler-waffle-burger/), Bacon-Wrapped Pickle Dog, and ‚ÄúKind of a Big Dill‚Äù Lemonade from [Nordic Waffles](https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/1476.1/)

Another vendor that fills up immediately after opening, Nordic Waffle should be top of your list because
of two returning new foods from 2023: the Bacon-Wrapped Pickle Dog and the Pickle Lemonade. Both of these are
really great, the lemonade sounds strange but works really well (even if you don't love pickles). The subtle saltiness
balances out the sweet and tartness which makes for a dangerously drinkable item.

The Wrangler was good, it's one of those winning combinations of flavors that is really hard to mess up:
beef, cheese, caramelized onions, and a mayo-based sauce. The onions being grilled into the waffle was
fun but didn't do much flavor-wise (they might as well have been a topping), honestly wish they went all-out on the onions to the point of being
noticeable texture-wise in the waffle. The bacon-wrapped pickle dog is as awesome as it sounds, so much more interesting flavor-wise!

I'm also not a fan of their choice of sauce, they went with Whataburger, a [famously mid-tier](https://youtu.be/c5HHnCmxBRE?feature=shared&t=36) burger joint in **Texas**, of all places?
This is a grave error by Nordic Waffles because Minnesota and Texas have serious State Fair beef.
Minnesota seeing the highest single-day attendance over 12 days, where the Texas State Fair sees the highest total attendance over **24 days** (it might be obvious which State Fair I think is the true champion).

## [Sweet Corn Cola Float](https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/sweet-corn-cola-float/) from [Blue Moon Dine-in Theater](https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/212.1)

This one was interesting! Sweet Corn icecream *and* house-made ‚Äúcorn Cola‚Äù, so I take that to mean
corn syrup Cola? Not sure. The flavor definitely gave a ‚Äúnot-too-sweet‚Äù vibe which was nice, there was a good amount of a corny
and almost ‚Äúearthy‚Äù flavor in the float.

The texture of the corn icecream was a little less smooth
than a normal icecream, which landed somewhere between novel and ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù.
I actually recommend giving this one a good mix before you drink it to blend the
flavors together better, you're only given a boba straw to drink it.

Overall, would I get it again? Probably not, because Lift Bridge root beer floats exist and are much better. But worth a try!

## [Sweet Heat Bacon Crunch](https://www.mnstatefair.org/new-this-year/food/sweet-heat-bacon-crunch/) from [RC's BBQ](https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/3217.1)

Had this one side-by-side with my typical order from RC's which is a bunch of ribs and
yeah, it was fine, but if I'm buying barbecue I want ribs or brisket. There was some chili crisp
(but not much, maybe because it's Minnesota) and hot honey that got a bit lost in the dish.
Can't recommend this one, RC's usual items are much better.

## Spam breakfast sandwich from [SPAM](https://www.mnstatefair.org/vendor/8073.1/)

Attention all SPAM-lovers at the fair! The SPAM booth has moved from under the Grandstand bridge
to the southern edge of the DNR building. I nearly had a heart-attack when I saw the SPAM booth
wasn't in its usual spot, I had to sneak away with a fellow SPAM-lover from our group to snag
this item.

We got ours with pickles (surprise!) and jalape√±os, a little bit of kick and acid to cut through the lovely fatty grilled SPAM.
Pretty sure this little sandwich was gone in 4 bites, highly recommend finding this stand if you're
a long-time-enjoyer or first-timer of SPAM!

That's all for this year. At this point we kept trying new items, but I suspect not being hungry
started to impact my opinions of the foods, so you'll have to try them yourself! :)
