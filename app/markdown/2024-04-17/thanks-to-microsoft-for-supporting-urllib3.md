<p>Back in January <a href="https://sethmlarson.dev/urllib3-is-fundraising-for-http2-support">we announced that urllib3 would be fundraising</a>
to implement support for HTTP/2 in a backwards compatible
way to urllib3 v2.x and to ensure the project's development
remains sustainable in the long-term.</p>

<p>Microsoft has awarded urllib3 $5,000 USD as one of its

Thank you, Microsoft for supporting open source software!</p>

<p>Since announcing our fundraiser we have raised $7,275 USD
in 3 months, many of the donations coming from individuals
and long-time sponsors like Sourcegraph and Sentry.</p>

## How to get started supporting your own dependencies?

[Contribute directly to projects you depend on](https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund?tab=readme-ov-file#2024).
  Many of them already have funding mechanisms documented like Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors, or similar.

Subscribe to an organization like [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-urllib3)
  to handle discovery of dependencies and fundable projects
  and to get additional guarantees like security and long-term support.

[Thanks.dev](https://thanks.dev) provides a lightweight option to throw money in open sources' direction.
