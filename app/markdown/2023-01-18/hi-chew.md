# Hi-Chew Pokédex

I love the idea of having "personal Pokédexes", a set of known things out there in the world that you want to collect.
My current personal Pokédex is [Hi-Chew](https://www.hi-chew.com) flavors. Below I've listed ones I've either tried or aspire to try one day.
What's your personal Pokédex?

## Flavors

There are **over 200 unique flavors of Hi-Chew**, so this list is hopelessly incomplete. Even the website [only lists 21 flavors](https://www.hi-chew.com/flavors). 
I'll [keep the list up-to-date](#additions) as I find and try new flavors. If I'm missing a flavor or something is incorrect please
[open an issue](https://github.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/issues) or [send a pull request](https://github.com/sethmlarson/sethmlarson.dev/tree/master/app/markdown/2023-01-18/hi-chew.md).

## Rules and format

I try to avoid ordering things online, too easy that way!

Hi-Chew are typically sold in "Sticks" of a single flavor, however they are also sold in "Mixes" of 2-3 flavors.
Whenever a flavor is offered as a mix I list it in the table. Mix names sometimes are the same between the US and Japan,
so I have to disambiguate with US and JP.

Some flavors are slight variants of each other (ie "Lemon" versus "New Sour Lemon").
I'll make a judgement call whether a flavor is unique enough for its own entry.

I don't list any of the "Premium" flavor of Hi-Chew as the texture is apparently more like mochi? I haven't tried one to be sure myself.
I also don't list the "Reduced Sugar" because they also change the texture.
