## Windows CPython SBOMs

I've finished up work for Software Bill-of-Materials for generating Windows CPython artifacts,
these PRs are being reviewed by Windows release managers. A few things left to do:

* Run integration tests for the proposed Azure Pipelines definition.
* Add small change to upload procedure for Windows artifacts to also upload the new SBOM artifacts.

After Windows is complete the only platform left is macOS which I've asked release managers about the best way to get started for this platform.

I'll be taking a break from weekly updates in March because I'll be traveling in early and late March
meaning I'll only have ~5 normal work days, so if you're curious why there aren't any weekly updates
that will be why. ‚úàÔ∏è

That's all for this week! üëã If you're interested in more you can read [next week's report](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-32) or [last week's report](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-30).
